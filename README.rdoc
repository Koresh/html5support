= HTML 5 Support

Support certain HTML 5 attributes with javascript, but only if the browser doesn't already support them.

Currently supports the placeholder attribute and the autofocus attribute.

== Example

=== HTML
	
	<input type="text" autofocus />
	<input type="text" placeholder="Search Here" name="q" />
	
== jQuery

	$.html5support();
